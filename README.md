This is a challenge for a vacation jog on AG Capital

The challenge consists of developing an interface for managing projects segmented by clients. The application scope must meet the following requirements:
- **Client and Project Management:** Visualization and control (adding, editing, and removing) of clients and their respective projects;
- **Lifecycle Management:** Functionality to close or reopen projects;
- **Task Management:** Activity control per project, allowing task management and status transitions between "Todo", "Doing", "Done", and "Cancelled";
- **Search and Filtering:** Search functionality for projects and clients, including tab-based filters for project status (open or closed).
- **Integration and State Management:** Mock integrations using a state manager
